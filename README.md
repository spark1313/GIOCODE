# The Codex of The Giomancer:
You have uncovered the Codex of The Giomancer! Rumor says the hidden knowledge that lies within rival even that of the Install Wizard. This is the Table of Contents.

# Chapter 1: Spellcraft
Giomancy spellcraft containing an assortment of knowledge such as documented solutions to issues for reference, lessons learned, and first-hand experience to bolster your wisdom. They say that forum posts eventually get lost in the ether one day...but codices are eternal.

# Chapter 2: Sourcery
So let it be written, so let it be done. Sourcery inscribed into these pages shall be materialized elsewhere. This is a collection of useful CLI Copy Pastas for quick reference so I don't have to go read the man page and reinvent them again.

### [Prequel](Sourcery/prequel.sh)
* The prequel to the pasta. Shell commands interacting with SQL DBs which are themselves not direct SQL queries are catalogged here
### [Spices](Sourcery/spices.sh)
* Can't eat pasta without proper seasoning and spices. Assortment of useful commands but not significant enough to be in their own listing
### [Hotkeys](Sourcery/hotkeys.txt)
* The cooking vessel must get hot enough to boil the water. Wait, you made the keys hot instead?
### [Renaming](Sourcery/renaming.sh)
* Linux CLI to selectively rename groups of files
### [Smart Testing](Sourcery/smart.sh)
* Linux CLI using smartctl to check drive SMART stats and run tests
### [Drive Wiping](Sourcery/zero.sh)
* Linux CLI commands to wipe a drive and verify
### [Drive Benchmarking](Sourcery/benchmark.sh)
* How fast does pasta cook? Well, let's run a benchmark. These are commands to run benchmarks on a drive
### [Drive Recovery](Sourcery/ddr.sh)
* Cookware busted? Can't dance? Try and recover hard drive data with ~~ddr_help~~ dd_rhelp
### [SeekAndDestroy](Sourcery/seekAndDestroy.sh)
* Find files of a certain criteria and delete them
### [Sequel](Sourcery/sequel.sql)
* The sequel to the pasta - you might be a Pastafarian at this point. SQL queries interacting with DBs are catalogged here

# [Chapter 3: Scripture](Scripture)
Incantations crafted and written into these pages may be read to expedite manual invocation of individual fragments of Giomancy.
Different schools of Giomancy have their own sections.

# [Appendix](appendix.txt)
The appendix written by my first apprentice as they began to dabble into spellcraft.
