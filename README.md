You have uncovered the Codex of The Giomancer! Rumor says the hidden knowledge that lies within rival even that of the Install Wizard. This is the Table of Contents.

## [Chapter 1: Spellcraft](Spellcraft)
Giomancy spellcraft containing an assortment of knowledge such as documented solutions to issues for reference, lessons learned, and first-hand experience to bolster your wisdom. They say that forum posts eventually get lost in the ether one day...but codices are eternal.

## [Chapter 2: Sourcery](Sourcery)
So let it be written, so let it be done. Sourcery inscribed into these pages shall be materialized elsewhere. This is a collection of useful CLI Copy Pastas for quick reference so I don't have to go read the man page and reinvent them again.

Incantations crafted and written into these pages may be read to expedite manual invocation of individual fragments of Giomancy.<br>
Different schools of Giomancy have their own sections.

## [Appendix](appendix.txt)
The appendix notes learnings written by my first apprentice as they began to dabble into spellcraft.<br>
You notice some text scrawled towards the beginning that appears to be an incantation of some kind:<br>
