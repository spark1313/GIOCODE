# Chapter 2: Sourcery
So let it be written, so let it be done. Sourcery inscribed into these pages shall be materialized elsewhere. This is a collection of useful CLI Copy Pastas for quick reference so I don't have to go read the man page and reinvent them again.

### [Prequel](prequel.sh)
* The prequel to the pasta. Shell commands interacting with SQL DBs which are themselves not direct SQL queries are catalogged here
### [Spices](spices.sh)
* Can't eat pasta without proper seasoning and spices. Assortment of useful commands but not significant enough to be in their own listing
### [Hotkeys](hotkeys.txt)
* The cooking vessel must get hot enough to boil the water. Wait, you made the keys hot instead?
### [Renaming](renaming.sh)
* Linux CLI to selectively rename groups of files
### [Smart Testing](smart.sh)
* Linux CLI using smartctl to check drive SMART stats and run tests
### [Drive Wiping](zero.sh)
* Linux CLI commands to wipe a drive and verify
### [Drive Benchmarking](benchmark.sh)
* How fast does pasta cook? Well, let's run a benchmark. These are commands to run benchmarks on a drive
### [Drive Recovery](ddr.sh)
* Cookware busted? Can't dance? Try and recover hard drive data with ~~ddr_help~~ dd_rhelp
### [SeekAndDestroy](seekAndDestroy.sh)
* Find files of a certain criteria and delete them
### [Sequel](sequel.sql)
* The sequel to the pasta - you might be a Pastafarian at this point. SQL queries interacting with DBs are catalogged here
