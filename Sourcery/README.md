# Chapter 2: Sourcery
So let it be written, so let it be done. Sourcery inscribed into these pages shall be materialized elsewhere. This is a collection of useful CLI Copy Pastas for quick reference so I don't have to go read the man page and reinvent them again.

### [Prequel](prequel.sh)
* The prequel to the codex! Here be shell commands for interacting with SQL DBs which are themselves not direct SQL queries.
### [Cantrips](cantrips.sh)
* Assortment of useful commands but not significant enough to be in their own listing
### [Hotkeys](hotkeys.txt)
* There's a hotkey for that.
### [Renaming](renaming.sh)
* Linux CLI to selectively rename groups of files
### [Smart Testing](smart.sh)
* Linux CLI using smartctl to check drive SMART stats and run tests
### [Drive Wiping](zero.sh)
* Linux CLI commands to wipe a drive and verify
### [Drive Benchmarking](benchmark.sh)
* These are commands to run benchmarks on a drive.
### [Drive Recovery](ddr.sh)
* May or may not involve dancing? Try and recover hard drive data with ~~ddr_help~~ dd_rhelp
### [SeekAndDestroy](seekAndDestroy.sh)
* Find files of a certain criteria and delete them.
### [Sequel](sequel.sql)
* Is there even a sequel to the codex? The world may never know. Here be SQL queries for interacting with databases.
