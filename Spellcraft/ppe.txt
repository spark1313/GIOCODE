When doing many handy activities, things can get messy and injuries are common. Often things get kicked up in dust or make some waste or flake off. Wear appropriate PPE to protect yourself.

#Hands:
Wear gloves when you do things that have any potential of damaging your skin. I always wear gloves now following this after injuring and scarring my finger from racking a server without gloves on.

#Eyes:
Wear eyeglasses or even full face goggles or mask when doing things with a potential of damaging your eyes. There are a lot of these! The most common for me are:
-Weed whacking / string trimming: plant matter which could potentially be poisonous, insect parts, wood chips, rocks
-Blowing: dust
-Sawing: wood and especially metal
-Welding
-Screwing: metal shavings

If metal shavings from small screw stripping or sawing get in your eyes, it may get lodged in there and rust into your eyeball which has a brine layer. You do NOT want to learn how rusty metal shavings are removed from being lodged into surface of your eyeball.
