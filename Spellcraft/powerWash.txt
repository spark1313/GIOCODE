Before power washing confirm whether using just water or a chemical mix for treating mildew and mold.
If using a chemical mix, it likely contains bleach and will damage most things it comes into contact with. Siding is less resistant to bleach but paint and anything metal will be directly and harshly affected. The metal will corrode and the paint will develop little blotches all over it. Doorknob locks will corrode and likely need to be wiped and relubricated.
