Never paint a house in flat paint. Even if someone insists how good their flat paint is and how far paint tech has come. You will regret it. Especially if you have kids or animals.
Paint with a minimum of eggshell on the walls and one level glossier on trim.
Always paint bathrooms and closets in semi-gloss.
